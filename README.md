# Welcome to Battleship!
### Fully functional web based game of Battleship! 
BattleShip is a two-player game where each player takes turns secretly placing ships, and then shooting at, and attempting to sink the opposing player's ships.  The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins.


This project was built to expand a previous team's project by fixing existing bugs, adding difficulty levels, and an option to play against a computer as well as several other custom additions.
## Game Options

#### Player vs Computer: play against an AI with three difficulty options
######   1. Easy: random guesses
